cRaZy F1 dRiVeRâ€™s game concept is simple, move the F1 car left or right using the arrow keys to avoid incoming traffic. After every five cars that have been overtaken, the speed of all incoming traffic increases by one, subsequently increasing difficulty.
The game makes use of two animations, one to power the background while driving, while the other is used to display an explosion animation after a crash. The only image effect used in the game was GrayscaleFX to simulate the burnt car after the explosion caused by a crash.
